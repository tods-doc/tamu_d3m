=============================

TODO: Document how error handling is done in the reference runtime (exceptions inside pipeline captured, unexpected exceptions from runtime not captured).

TODO: Document how captured exceptions have __cause__ to get original exception.

TODO: Document how one can use exposing of produced values to debug.

TODO: Document how to get quickly to a pipeline prefix so that you can test your primitive.
